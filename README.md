## Overview
This project demonstrates the following:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing individual features through histograms.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Visualizing relationships between features and target variables.
- **KNN Classification**: Training and evaluating a KNN classifier.
- **KNN Regression**: Training and evaluating a KNN regressor.
- **Model Saving**: Saving trained models as `.pkl` files.
- **Model Loading**: Loading saved models and making predictions with new data.
